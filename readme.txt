This folder contains the data management scripts used with REACCH Objective 2 
monitoring sites. Please ensure the production scripts located on the share
server under /proj/2011_REACCH/scripts/ are not modified inadvertently. 

Subfolder       Contents
---------       --------
/bin            Binary executables including third-party programs
/doc            Documentation for users and researchers
/igorpro        Scripts written for use with Igor Pro

Batch files in the root folder provide a simplified way of interacting with 
the various scripts. In general, the shortcuts are designed to be used on the
share workstation in Dana 216; some users may need to create a copy of the 
batch files and modify the specified drive letter for use on their own
workstation.

Release Notes
=============

### Version 0.4.4 ###

- Hotfix applied to telemetry processing script so only REACCH-related files
  are processed and deleted (!). Applied fix is still imperfect: it would
  affect future additions if they follow the same naming convention for the
  station in Loggernet (e.g. "REMOTE_<something>")

### Version 0.4.3 ###

- Minor tweaks to axis settings in telemetry plots:
    * Clarify labels on logger panel temp. and friction velocity plots
    * Set static bounds (+/-1000m) on Obukhov length plot axis
- Reorder sites in telemetry plot summary to group by locality
- Shortcuts are removed in favor of those on the share host's desktop and
  start menu
- Add Overview section to readme explaining each script

### Version 0.4.2 ###

- New script `email_telemetry_plots.py` generates plots of data collected by 
  telemetry from all five tower monitoring sites over the last 24 hours, 
  exports the plots to a PDF file and emails the PDF to a list of individuals. 
    * Runs automatically as part of the daily telemetry data processing task
    * Can be run independently if necessary
- New script `rebuild_telemetry_files.py` reconstructs monitoring tower 
  "telemetry" data files (L0_telemetry) from the "raw plain-text" files
  (L0_raw_ascii) using the standardizing script `standardize_toa5.py`. This
  represents the first step to patching "raw plain-text" files with data in the
  "telemetry" data files. 

### Version 0.4.1 ###

- Apply hotfix to `process_new_telemetry_data.py` which fixes script's ability
  to locate correct destination directory

### Version 0.4.0 ###

- Script launching batch files replaced with shortcuts; solves issue with
  command reverting to Windows directory because of starting with UNC path
  as CWD and thus failing to find targets
- New graphical program for transferring timelapse image photos released:
  `SDTransferUtility.pyw` replaces `transfer_timelapse_photos.py`
    * Finds images using file name mask (e.g. searches multiple directories)
    * Automatic preview of selected image file
    * Process images from multiple locations (handled per directory)
    * No external dependency on Ant Renamer
    * Still only Windows-only
- Overhaul of CompactFlash memory card transfer program
    * More informative file characterization
    * Automatic exclusion of non-REACCH/invalid data files
    * Begin processing with single button press
    * Input file names are no longer permanently modified
    * Enhanced options availability: 
        . Set parameters for identifying & splitting large files
        . Specify target folder for standardized output
    * Process files from multiple sites simulataneously
    * Threading speeds up some processing steps
    * Still requires monitoring to acknowledge CardConvert dialogs
- Updated path definitions are cleaner to use

### Version 0.3.1 ###

- Hot-fix correction of directory path handling in relation to timelapse
  camera image transfer script

### Version 0.3 ###

- Release of script for processing newly downloaded telemetry data into 
  standard format and appending to existing data files
- Definitions now contained in groups across multiple files:
    * fileio : functions to open files, sniff properties, etc
    * paths  : locations of directories and files
    * sites  : objects containing monitoring site attributes
    * tables : functions and dictionaries representing data file structure 

### Version 0.2.3 ###

- Support added for new monitoring site 'MSLK'
- Changes to CompactFlash Transfer Utility
    * Applies standard formatting to plain-text files created by Card Convert
    * Improved support for ejecting card
- Changes to timelapse photo transfer script
    * Site options now pulled from definitions, not hard-coded

### Version 0.2 ###

- Changes to CompactFlash Transfer Utility
    * Now depends upon ``definitions.py`` for paths & site code definitions
    * Breaks large files (>200MB) into smaller ones (~100MB)
    * Sets read-only+archive attributes on generated ASCII files too now
    * FIX: path choices are no longer cleared if dialog is cancelled
    * Prompts to confirm exit if source directory still contains files 
- Changes to timelapse photo transfer script:
    * No longer requires separate renaming batch script (but does still depend 
      on objects in ``definitions.py``)
    * Renames files on hard disk -- massive speed improvement
    * Supports overwriting if files already exist in destination

### Version 0.1 ###

- Not really an initial release but first official release
- Can transfer binary data from CompactFlash cards, generate ASCII files, then 
  empty and eject CF card. [``python/CFTransferUtility.pyw``]
- Can transfer photos taken by timelapse cameras, rename then empty and eject
  SD card. [``python/transfer_timelapse_photos.py``]
